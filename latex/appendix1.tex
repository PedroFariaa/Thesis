\chapter{Feature Analysis} \label{ap1:feat_analysis}

This appendix presents all the results of the feature analysis that was performed in order to understand the impact that the clinical features have on the wound healing simulation.

The analysis of the clinical features was done by comparing the displacement of the corresponding points in the pre and pos-surgical models of the breast models between variations of the same patient, where one of the clinical features was changing, and the others were kept the constant. The clinical features that were analysed were the tumor's size, the tumor's region and the density of the breast.
