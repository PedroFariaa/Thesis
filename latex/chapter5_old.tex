\section*{}

The application of DNN, in this case, to predict the deformations caused by the breast healing after a Breast Cancer Conservative Treatment, despite of the good results that it would lead to is a very time consuming techniques. For this reason, it is important to use representation models with the least number of parameters possible in order to speed up the prediction model obtainment process. Considering this, the FFD based on parametric models would be the best option to represent the patient's breast models. Another drawback is the few data that is available, that can be solved by the generation of a synthetic dataset based on real patients describer in chapter 4. For the synthetic data generation the FE models used on the surgical simulator presented in chapter 3, can be used as ground truth and applied to the parametric models.
